## Examples

We have several examples [on the React website](https://reactjs.org/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloMessage name="Taylor" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.
